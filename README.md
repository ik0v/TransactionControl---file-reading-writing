Program that reads initial balance from one text file,
and transactions from another text file.
If sum of transactions plus initial balance >= 0
Then text file is updated with new balance.
Otherwise error message is printed out.
I before transaction stands for "in"
U stands for "out" (norwegian "ut")


Example of program running:

Initial balance: 6350.20
Transactions: [410.0, -3125.0, -5214.5, 1230.0, -2500.0, -432.1, 5000.6] sum = -4631.0
Transactions successful, new balance:
1719.20
Process finished with exit code 0
